#' minimalRSD: A package for constructing CCD and BBD with minimum
#' level changes in the run sequence
#'
#' The minimalRSD package can be used to construct Central Composite
#' Designs (CCD) with full as well as fractional factorial points(half replicate)
#' and Box Behnken designs (BBD) with minimum number
#' of changes in the levels of input factors. These designs help in providing reducing
#' cost-effective Response Surface Designs (RSDs).
#' This package provides three categories of important functions:
#' min-bbd, min_ccd and min_ccd_2.
#'
#' @section minimalRSD functions:
#' min_bbd: Generate minimally changed BBD for a given number of input factors. \cr
#' min_ccd: Generate minimally changed CCD for a given number of input factors. \cr
#' min_ccd_2: Generate minimally changed CCD with fractinalfactorial points
#' (half replicate) for a given number of factors. \cr

#' @details The package minimalRSD is an implementation of the concepts
#' and theory discussed by Varghese et al. (2017). For detailed information
#' and concepts users are advised to see the following reference.
